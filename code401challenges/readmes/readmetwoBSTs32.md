# Repeated values in two BSTS
- Author: Jack Daniel Kinne.
- Challenge by: Codefellows.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.
  
## Approach & Efficiency
- use BST trees.  output a traversal list.
- If bst.contains returns true for both trees, push into output List.
- return output list.

## Testing
- test for values matches
- test for no matches
- test for null
