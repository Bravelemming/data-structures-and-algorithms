Author: Jack Daniel Kinne.
Challenge by: Codefellows.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- write a function fizzbuzztree, which takes a tree, and returns fizz on /3, 
buzz on /5, and fizbuzz on /3 and /5.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, 
determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, 
and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.

## Approach & Efficiency
