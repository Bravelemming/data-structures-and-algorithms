# Binary Tree Max Value
Author: Jack Daniel Kinne.
Challenge by: Codefellows.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- write a function to find the maximum value in a binary tree.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. 
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, 
return the maximum value stored in the tree. 
You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- use any search algorithm,
- add the max value to an int, if larger than current.
- return int
