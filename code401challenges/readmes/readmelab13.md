# Multi bracket validation
Author: Jack Daniel Kinne.
Challenge by: Codefellows.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- write a tree class, node, and binary search options for in order, post, and pre.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, 
the left child node, and the right child node.
  Create a BinaryTree class
  Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, 
  inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered 
  appropriately.
- Create a BinarySearchTree class
  Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with 
  that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean 
  indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- wrote out stub methods.
- wrote helper functions to rotate through nodes, to reuse code.
- wrote out comments to guide function layouts.

### Tests:
- Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
- Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
- Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
- Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
